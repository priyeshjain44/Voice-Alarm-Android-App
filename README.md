# About

An android application that helps users to record his/her voice as an alarm ringtone before setting an alarm. Once the alarm is triggered, the userâ€™s recorded audio/message will be played as alarm ringtone instead of the default one. 

# Things to be taken care of

1. First, set the reminder title, date, time and other details and then only start the recording. It is because the recording is saved with name of a request code obtained from the date and time you have set. 

2. To stop the triggering alarm, click on the STOP action button in the notification sent for the respective alarm.

3. You cannot update an existing alarm but you can always create a new once.

4. Alarm trigger may have a delay of just a few seconds, as it takes some time for media Player to fetch your recording and play it.



Enjoyyyyy the app :)
